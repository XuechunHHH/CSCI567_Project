# CSCI567_Project

For Neural Networks, the models are in ```perceptron.py``` and ```nn.py```. The ```scikit_nn.py``` file is for reference only.
To see results, run ```python perceptron.py``` and ```python nn.py```. If you don't want to see to confusion matrices, you can comment out lines 68 and 87 in ```perceptron.py``` and line 192 in ```nn.py```.
