# CSCI567_Project

The original data is cirrhosis.csv. The rest data files are all processed data. The process files are in Data Process.

For Neural Networks, the models are in ```perceptron.py``` and ```nn.py```. The ```scikit_nn.py``` file is for reference only.
To see results, run ```python perceptron.py``` and ```python nn.py```. If you don't want to see to confusion matrices, you can comment out lines 68 and 87 in ```perceptron.py``` and line 192 in ```nn.py```.

For LogisticRegression, the basic model is in ```LogisticRegression.ipynb``` and the model applied SMOTE is in ```LogisticRegression_SMOTE.ipynb```. The model drop Class 2 and do binary classification is in ```LogisticRegression_drop2.ipynb```.

For Decision Tree And Random Forest, the models are in ```DecisionTree.ipynb```.

For Support Vector Machine, the model is in ```SVM_Cirrhosis.m```.
